How do we set up our very own database on docker?
First of all, verify that docker desktop is downloaded and is working.
then, with docker desktop running, run this command in terminal:

docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=P@SSWORD123" -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest

In dbeaver, open a connection for a microsoft sql server.
In connection settings, use host localhost, port 1433, database/schema master, username sa, password P@SSWORD123. Test connection and verify that connection is successful before clicking OK.

Your docker container MUST be running to use the database!

Right click on your DB connection on the left, navigate to sql editor and generate a new sql script. You should work on the practice problems in these sql scripts.

Use the arrows on the left side of the editor to run sql commands. Please note that the top arrow will run a single line that your cursor is on, and the arrow inside a scroll will run the whole script, and break whenever you have an error. I recommend using ctrl+enter to run a single line quickly.

DBeaver may not refresh automatically. If you are confused why your changes to eg create tables arent reflected in the connections screen on the left, press f5 to refresh dbeaver.
